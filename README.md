# Web-Scraping-App

This application is generic code written in Python to build a web scraping application using Beautiful Soup. The code in this program will allow the user to parse through the HTML of the website to show residents of the Boone County Jail.

After parsing, the program will save the information to a CSV file (spreadsheet/Excel) to list the following offender information:

- First, Middle and Last name.
- Gender, Race, Age
- City, State
